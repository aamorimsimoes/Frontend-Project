# Final frontend project for Fullstack Web Delevoper Course

The project aimed to fulfill the front-end part of my full-stack web development course requirements using HTML, CSS and JS (The Client-Side Of The Web). 
I used [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) by personal choice, a free and an open-source [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) powered framework, a Vue-powered static site generator (model–view–view model: MVVM - software architectural pattern) for building the user interface and single-page application.
</br>
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is the module bundler used and its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging.

</br>
Modules used:
</br>
- [postcss-scss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-scss) A SCSS parser for [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/);
- [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles;
- [vue-svg-loader](https://vue-svg-loader.js.org/) enables the use of SVG files as Vue components; 

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) who's connected to my GitHub repository pulling my source code) was used to deploy and host my project website.
