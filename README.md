# Final frontend project for Fullstack Web Delevoper Course

The project aimed to fulfilling several course requirements using HTML, CSS and JS (The Client-Side Of The Web). 
By personal choice I used [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) (free & open source [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)-powered framework (model–view–viewmodel (MVVM - software architectural pattern) ) for building the user interface and single-page application.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (who's connected to my GitHub repository pulling my source code) was used to deploy and host my project website.
